You have been contracted by a high-power, multinational corporation to create a program in the Python language that will prompt the user for the radius of a circle, calculate the area and circumference of the circle, and provide that information back to the user.
You should use the Python Math Module to ensure a correct value for PI
These folks pay top dollar, but they expect the program to be well written, well commented, and to provide the best user experience possible.
